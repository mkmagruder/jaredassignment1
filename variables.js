//1. DECLARE a variable named cartons using let (NOTE: just declare it, dont set it)




//2. SET the variable to any integer (Set that variable!)





//3. Declare AND set a new variable named numberOfEggs . This variable should be equal to the variable you set in the previous line
//   multiplied by 12.





//4. Log the output. 




//5. Reassign the variable numberOfEggs to a string value. Make the string value something fun, like a person from the neighborhood!





//6. Log the output





//7. Concatenate that string with another string. Assign this to a new variable. NOTE: remeber the CPU takes everything literally, remember spaces!
//we didn't go over this really. But to concatenate its just string1 + string2 




//8. Log the output!
